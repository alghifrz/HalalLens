# HalalLens 📱

A mobile app that helps Muslims verify the halal status of food products using barcode scanning and OCR, with accessibility features for travelers, seniors, and the color-blind.

---

1. **Frequent travelers** — by translating ingredients and recognizing foreign food labels.
2. **Seniors** — through simplified UI, larger touch targets, and clear visuals.
3. **Color-blind users** — via customizable high-contrast themes and color-tested UI elements.

## 📱 Tech Stack

- **Flutter** – single codebase for Android and iOS.
- **Barcode Scanner** – mobile camera integration for real-time scanning.
- **Tesseract OCR** – embedded library for text recognition.
